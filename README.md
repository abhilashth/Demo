Selenium Webdriver Code:
-----------------------

=> We can run the testclasses 'LoginTest.java' and 'HomeTest.java' as a part of testng xml(testng.xml) and also can run single test method from any of the IDE (IntellijIdea) is preferred,
   and below are some of the assumptions.

1. Selenium webdriver with java bindings
2. TestNG as unit test framework
3. Running in windows(windows 11) environment

Imp: If you want to run in any of the specific browser(firefox/chrome/ie), then go to application.properties file and change the "browser" paramters.
     valid parameters are "firefox/chrome/ie".
